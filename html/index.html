                Education is the process of facilitating learning and the acquisition of knowledge, skills, values,
                beliefs, and habits. Educational methods encompass teaching, training, storytelling, discussion, and
                directed research. Education often occurs under the guidance of educators, but learners can also engage
                in self-education. Education can occur in formal or informal settings, and any experience that has a
                formative effect on the way one thinks, feels, or acts may be considered educational. The methodology of
                teaching in Zambia is referred to as pedagogy.

                The transformation of education in India is a comprehensive effort focused on improving the quality,
                accessibility, and inclusivity of learning opportunities throughout the country. Key initiatives and
                reforms have been implemented to address challenges in the education system.

                Digital learning and technology integration in classrooms play a significant role in this
                transformation. The National Education Policy (NEP) of 2020 underscores the importance of technology for
                personalized and flexible learning experiences, aiming to equip students with 21st-century skills to
                navigate a rapidly changing global landscape.

            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">
                The journey of education began in prehistoric times, marked by the transfer of knowledge and skills from
                adults to the younger generation. In preliterate societies, education primarily relied on oral
                communication and imitation, with storytelling playing a pivotal role in transmitting knowledge, values,
                and skills across generations.
                As societies progressed, formal education systems started to develop. An accurate point mentions the
                establishment of schools in Egypt during the Middle Kingdom period. However, the transition to this
                historical fact feels abrupt, necessitating additional context to maintain a cohesive narrative.

            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">
                Another critical aspect of the transformation is the emphasis on skill development and vocational
                training. The objective is to align education with the demands of the job market, fostering practical
                skills and entrepreneurship. This not only enhances employability but also contributes to the economic
                growth of the nation.
